# `nonfree`
A program for removing nonfree and proprietary software other than the OS.
## Creative Commons
Some programs have Creative Commons licenses, which Creative Commons does not recommend for code
(they instead recommend and use the GPLv3). However, there are CC NC and ND licenses
around the edge. Due to Wikipedia (plus other Wikimedia projects excluding Wikinews (CC BY 2.5),
some Wikimedia Commons files (various free CC licenses), andmost of Wikidata (CC0)),
the most popular CC license is BY-SA 3.0.
## Detection
This app detects the website of the app and checks text after the "Licensed under",
"Under", "Free software under the" or any related sentences.<br />If the license violates
the OSD and/or GNU's free software definition, or even the [Definition of Free Cultral Works](https://freedomdefined.org), this will uninstall
the program.

Examples of nonfree software include:
* Google Chrome, freeware (not open source). Google **does** have another similar open-source project under the [3-clause BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause "OSI License Page") called [Chromium](https://opensource.google/projects/chromium?hl=en "Chromium Page (opensource.google)").
* Windows, nonfree software using Microsoft's full copyright license. (Consider using FreeBSD, GNU/Hurd or GNU/Linux.)
* Some parts of [Ubuntu GNU/Linux](https://ubuntu.com "Ubuntu.com"), various. Ubuntu has the GNU userland since it is a derivative of Debian GNU/Linux.

I discourage use of these nonfree software or software linked to nonfree software (except BSD, GNU/Linux or GNU/Hurd distributions that use the nonfree software).
